pandas.Series.memory_usage#


Series.memory_usage(index=True, deep=False)[source]#
Return the memory usage of the Series.
The memory usage can optionally include the contribution of
the index and of elements of object dtype.

Parameters:

indexbool, default TrueSpecifies whether to include the memory usage of the Series index.

deepbool, default FalseIf True, introspect the data deeply by interrogating
object dtypes for system-level memory consumption, and include
it in the returned value.



Returns:

intBytes of memory consumed.





See also

numpy.ndarray.nbytesTotal bytes consumed by the elements of the array.

DataFrame.memory_usageBytes consumed by a DataFrame.



Examples
>>> s = pd.Series(range(3))
>>> s.memory_usage()
152


Not including the index gives the size of the rest of the data, which
is necessarily smaller:
>>> s.memory_usage(index=False)
24


The memory footprint of object values is ignored by default:
>>> s = pd.Series(["a", "b"])
>>> s.values
array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object)
>>> s.memory_usage()
144
>>> s.memory_usage(deep=True)
244
