pandas.Index.astype#


Index.astype(dtype, copy=True)[source]#
Create an Index with values cast to dtypes.
The class of a new Index is determined by dtype. When conversion is
impossible, a TypeError exception is raised.

Parameters:

dtypenumpy dtype or pandas typeNote that any signed integer dtype is treated as 'int64',
and any unsigned integer dtype is treated as 'uint64',
regardless of the size.

copybool, default TrueBy default, astype always returns a newly allocated object.
If copy is set to False and internal requirements on dtype are
satisfied, the original data is used to create a new Index
or the original Index is returned.



Returns:

IndexIndex with values cast to specified dtype.




Examples
>>> idx = pd.Index([1, 2, 3])
>>> idx
Index([1, 2, 3], dtype='int64')
>>> idx.astype('float')
Index([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype='float64')
