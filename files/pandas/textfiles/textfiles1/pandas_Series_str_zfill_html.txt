pandas.Series.str.zfill#


Series.str.zfill(width)[source]#
Pad strings in the Series/Index by prepending â0â characters.
Strings in the Series/Index are padded with â0â characters on the
left of the string to reach a total string length width. Strings
in the Series/Index with length greater or equal to width are
unchanged.

Parameters:

widthintMinimum length of resulting string; strings with length less
than width be prepended with â0â characters.



Returns:

Series/Index of objects.

Series.str.rjustFills the left side of strings with an arbitrary character.

Series.str.ljustFills the right side of strings with an arbitrary character.

Series.str.padFills the specified sides of strings with an arbitrary character.

Series.str.centerFills both sides of strings with an arbitrary character.



Notes
Differs from str.zfill() which has special handling
for â+â/â-â in the string.
Examples
>>> s = pd.Series(['-1', '1', '1000', 10, np.nan])
>>> s
0      -1
1       1
2    1000
3      10
4     NaN
dtype: object


Note that 10 and NaN are not strings, therefore they are
converted to NaN. The minus sign in '-1' is treated as a
special character and the zero is added to the right of it
(str.zfill() would have moved it to the left). 1000
remains unchanged as it is longer than width.
>>> s.str.zfill(3)
0     -01
1     001
2    1000
3     NaN
4     NaN
dtype: object
