pandas.DataFrame.plot.scatter#


DataFrame.plot.scatter(x, y, s=None, c=None, **kwargs)[source]#
Create a scatter plot with varying marker point size and color.
The coordinates of each point are defined by two dataframe columns and
filled circles are used to represent each point. This kind of plot is
useful to see complex correlations between two variables. Points could
be for instance natural 2D coordinates like longitude and latitude in
a map or, in general, any pair of metrics that can be plotted against
each other.

Parameters:

xint or strThe column name or column position to be used as horizontal
coordinates for each point.

yint or strThe column name or column position to be used as vertical
coordinates for each point.

sstr, scalar or array-like, optionalThe size of each point. Possible values are:

A string with the name of the column to be used for markerâs size.
A single scalar so all points have the same size.
A sequence of scalars, which will be used for each pointâs size
recursively. For instance, when passing [2,14] all points size
will be either 2 or 14, alternatively.


cstr, int or array-like, optionalThe color of each point. Possible values are:

A single color string referred to by name, RGB or RGBA code,
for instance âredâ or â#a98d19â.
A sequence of color strings referred to by name, RGB or RGBA
code, which will be used for each pointâs color recursively. For
instance [âgreenâ,âyellowâ] all points will be filled in green or
yellow, alternatively.
A column name or position whose values will be used to color the
marker points according to a colormap.


**kwargsKeyword arguments to pass on to DataFrame.plot().



Returns:

matplotlib.axes.Axes or numpy.ndarray of them

Examples
Letâs see how to draw a scatter plot using coordinates from the values
in a DataFrameâs columns.
>>> df = pd.DataFrame([[5.1, 3.5, 0], [4.9, 3.0, 0], [7.0, 3.2, 1],
...                    [6.4, 3.2, 1], [5.9, 3.0, 2]],
...                   columns=['length', 'width', 'species'])
>>> ax1 = df.plot.scatter(x='length',
...                       y='width',
...                       c='DarkBlue')





And now with the color determined by a column as well.
>>> ax2 = df.plot.scatter(x='length',
...                       y='width',
...                       c='species',
...                       colormap='viridis')
