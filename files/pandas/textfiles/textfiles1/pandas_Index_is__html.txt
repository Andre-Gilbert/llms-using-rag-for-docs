pandas.Index.is_#


final Index.is_(other)[source]#
More flexible, faster check like is but that works through views.
Note: this is not the same as Index.identical(), which checks
that metadata is also the same.

Parameters:

otherobjectOther object to compare against.



Returns:

boolTrue if both have same underlying data, False otherwise.

>>> idx1.is_(idx1.view())
True


>>> idx1.is_(idx1.copy())
False
