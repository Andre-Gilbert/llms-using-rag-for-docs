pandas.Series.str.findall#


Series.str.findall(pat, flags=0)[source]#
Find all occurrences of pattern or regular expression in the Series/Index.
Equivalent to applying re.findall() to all the elements in the
Series/Index.

Parameters:

patstrPattern or regular expression.

flagsint, default 0Flags from re module, e.g. re.IGNORECASE (default is 0, which
means no flags).



Returns:

Series/Index of lists of stringsAll non-overlapping matches of pattern or regular expression in each
string of this Series/Index.





See also

countCount occurrences of pattern or regular expression in each string of the Series/Index.

extractallFor each string in the Series, extract groups from all matches of regular expression and return a DataFrame with one row for each match and one column for each group.

re.findallThe equivalent re function to all non-overlapping matches of pattern or regular expression in string, as a list of strings.



Examples
>>> s = pd.Series(['Lion', 'Monkey', 'Rabbit'])


The search for the pattern âMonkeyâ returns one match:
>>> s.str.findall('Monkey')
0          []
1    [Monkey]
2          []
dtype: object


On the other hand, the search for the pattern âMONKEYâ doesnât return any
match:
>>> s.str.findall('MONKEY')
0    []
1    []
2    []
dtype: object


Flags can be added to the pattern or regular expression. For instance,
to find the pattern âMONKEYâ ignoring the case:
>>> import re
>>> s.str.findall('MONKEY', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
0          []
1    [Monkey]
2          []
dtype: object


When the pattern matches more than one string in the Series, all matches
are returned:
>>> s.str.findall('on')
0    [on]
1    [on]
2      []
dtype: object


Regular expressions are supported too. For instance, the search for all the
strings ending with the word âonâ is shown next:
>>> s.str.findall('on$')
0    [on]
1      []
2      []
dtype: object


If the pattern is found more than once in the same string, then a list of
multiple strings is returned:
>>> s.str.findall('b')
0        []
1        []
2    [b, b]
dtype: object
