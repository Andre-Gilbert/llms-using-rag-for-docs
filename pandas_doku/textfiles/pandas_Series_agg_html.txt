pandas.Series.agg#


Series.agg(func=None, axis=0, *args, **kwargs)[source]#
Aggregate using one or more operations over the specified axis.

Parameters:

funcfunction, str, list or dictFunction to use for aggregating the data. If a function, must either
work when passed a Series or when passed to Series.apply.
Accepted combinations are:

function
string function name
list of functions and/or function names, e.g. [np.sum, 'mean']
dict of axis labels -> functions, function names or list of such.


axis{0 or âindexâ}Unused. Parameter needed for compatibility with DataFrame.

*argsPositional arguments to pass to func.

**kwargsKeyword arguments to pass to func.



Returns:

scalar, Series or DataFrameThe return can be:

scalar : when Series.agg is called with single function
Series : when DataFrame.agg is called with a single function
DataFrame : when DataFrame.agg is called with several functions

Return scalar, Series or DataFrame.

Series.applyInvoke function on a Series.

Series.transformTransform function producing a Series with like indexes.



Notes
The aggregation operations are always performed over an axis, either the
index (default) or the column axis. This behavior is different from
numpy aggregation functions (mean, median, prod, sum, std,
var), where the default is to compute the aggregation of the flattened
array, e.g., numpy.mean(arr_2d) as opposed to
numpy.mean(arr_2d, axis=0).
agg is an alias for aggregate. Use the alias.
Functions that mutate the passed object can produce unexpected
behavior or errors and are not supported. See Mutating with User Defined Function (UDF) methods
for more details.
A passed user-defined-function will be passed a Series for evaluation.
Examples
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> s
0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
dtype: int64


>>> s.agg('min')
1


>>> s.agg(['min', 'max'])
min   1
max   4
dtype: int64
