pandas.Series.diff#


Series.diff(periods=1)[source]#
First discrete difference of element.
Calculates the difference of a Series element compared with another
element in the Series (default is element in previous row).

Parameters:

periodsint, default 1Periods to shift for calculating difference, accepts negative
values.



Returns:

SeriesFirst differences of the Series.

Series.pct_changePercent change over given number of periods.

Series.shiftShift index by desired number of periods with an optional time freq.

DataFrame.diffFirst discrete difference of object.



Notes
For boolean dtypes, this uses operator.xor() rather than
operator.sub().
The result is calculated according to current dtype in Series,
however dtype of the result is always float64.
Examples
Difference with previous row
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8])
>>> s.diff()
0    NaN
1    0.0
2    1.0
3    1.0
4    2.0
5    3.0
dtype: float64


Difference with 3rd previous row
>>> s.diff(periods=3)
0    NaN
1    NaN
2    NaN
3    2.0
4    4.0
5    6.0
dtype: float64


Difference with following row
>>> s.diff(periods=-1)
0    0.0
1   -1.0
2   -1.0
3   -2.0
4   -3.0
5    NaN
dtype: float64


Overflow in input dtype
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 0], dtype=np.uint8)
>>> s.diff()
0      NaN
1    255.0
dtype: float64
