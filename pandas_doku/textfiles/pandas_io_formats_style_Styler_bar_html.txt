Styler.bar(subset=None, axis=0, *, color=None, cmap=None, width=100, height=100, align='mid', vmin=None, vmax=None, props='width: 10em;')[source]#
Draw bar chart in the cell backgrounds.

Changed in version 1.4.0.


Parameters:

subsetlabel, array-like, IndexSlice, optionalA valid 2d input to DataFrame.loc[<subset>], or, in the case of a 1d input
or single key, to DataFrame.loc[:, <subset>] where the columns are
prioritised, to limit data to before applying the function.

axis{0 or âindexâ, 1 or âcolumnsâ, None}, default 0Apply to each column (axis=0 or 'index'), to each row
(axis=1 or 'columns'), or to the entire DataFrame at once
with axis=None.

colorstr or 2-tuple/listIf a str is passed, the color is the same for both
negative and positive numbers. If 2-tuple/list is used, the
first element is the color_negative and the second is the
color_positive (eg: [â#d65f5fâ, â#5fba7dâ]).

cmapstr, matplotlib.cm.ColorMapA string name of a matplotlib Colormap, or a Colormap object. Cannot be
used together with color.

New in version 1.4.0.


widthfloat, default 100The percentage of the cell, measured from the left, in which to draw the
bars, in [0, 100].

heightfloat, default 100The percentage height of the bar in the cell, centrally aligned, in [0,100].

New in version 1.4.0.


alignstr, int, float, callable, default âmidâHow to align the bars within the cells relative to a width adjusted center.
If string must be one of:

âleftâ : bars are drawn rightwards from the minimum data value.
ârightâ : bars are drawn leftwards from the maximum data value.
âzeroâ : a value of zero is located at the center of the cell.
âmidâ : a value of (max-min)/2 is located at the center of the cell,
or if all values are negative (positive) the zero is
aligned at the right (left) of the cell.
âmeanâ : the mean value of the data is located at the center of the cell.

If a float or integer is given this will indicate the center of the cell.
If a callable should take a 1d or 2d array and return a scalar.

Changed in version 1.4.0.


vminfloat, optionalMinimum bar value, defining the left hand limit
of the bar drawing range, lower values are clipped to vmin.
When None (default): the minimum value of the data will be used.

vmaxfloat, optionalMaximum bar value, defining the right hand limit
of the bar drawing range, higher values are clipped to vmax.
When None (default): the maximum value of the data will be used.

propsstr, optionalThe base CSS of the cell that is extended to add the bar chart. Defaults to
âwidth: 10em;â.

New in version 1.4.0.
