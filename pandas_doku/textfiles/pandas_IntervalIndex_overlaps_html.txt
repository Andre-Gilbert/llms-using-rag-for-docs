pandas.IntervalIndex.overlaps#


IntervalIndex.overlaps(*args, **kwargs)[source]#
Check elementwise if an Interval overlaps the values in the IntervalArray.
Two intervals overlap if they share a common point, including closed
endpoints. Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not
overlap.

Parameters:

otherIntervalArrayInterval to check against for an overlap.



Returns:

ndarrayBoolean array positionally indicating where an overlap occurs.

Examples
>>> data = [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4)]
>>> intervals = pd.arrays.IntervalArray.from_tuples(data)
>>> intervals
<IntervalArray>
[(0, 1], (1, 3], (2, 4]]
Length: 3, dtype: interval[int64, right]


>>> intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(0.5, 1.5))
array([ True,  True, False])


Intervals that share closed endpoints overlap:
>>> intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(1, 3, closed='left'))
array([ True,  True, True])


Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap:
>>> intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(1, 2, closed='right'))
array([False,  True, False])
