pandas.Series.dot#


Series.dot(other)[source]#
Compute the dot product between the Series and the columns of other.
This method computes the dot product between the Series and another
one, or the Series and each columns of a DataFrame, or the Series and
each columns of an array.
It can also be called using self @ other.

Parameters:

otherSeries, DataFrame or array-likeThe other object to compute the dot product with its columns.



Returns:

scalar, Series or numpy.ndarrayReturn the dot product of the Series and other if other is a
Series, the Series of the dot product of Series and each rows of
other if other is a DataFrame or a numpy.ndarray between the Series
and each columns of the numpy array.

DataFrame.dotCompute the matrix product with the DataFrame.

Series.mulMultiplication of series and other, element-wise.



Notes
The Series and other has to share the same index if other is a Series
or a DataFrame.
Examples
>>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3])
>>> other = pd.Series([-1, 2, -3, 4])
>>> s.dot(other)
8
>>> s @ other
8
>>> df = pd.DataFrame([[0, 1], [-2, 3], [4, -5], [6, 7]])
>>> s.dot(df)
0    24
1    14
dtype: int64
>>> arr = np.array([[0, 1], [-2, 3], [4, -5], [6, 7]])
>>> s.dot(arr)
array([24, 14])
