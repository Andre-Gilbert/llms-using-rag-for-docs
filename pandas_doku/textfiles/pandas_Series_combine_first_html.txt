Examples
>>> s1 = pd.Series([1, np.nan])
>>> s2 = pd.Series([3, 4, 5])
>>> s1.combine_first(s2)
0    1.0
1    4.0
2    5.0
dtype: float64


Null values still persist if the location of that null value
does not exist in other
>>> s1 = pd.Series({'falcon': np.nan, 'eagle': 160.0})
>>> s2 = pd.Series({'eagle': 200.0, 'duck': 30.0})
>>> s1.combine_first(s2)
duck       30.0
eagle     160.0
falcon      NaN
dtype: float64
