pandas.Series.autocorr#


Series.autocorr(lag=1)[source]#
Compute the lag-N autocorrelation.
This method computes the Pearson correlation between
the Series and its shifted self.

Parameters:

lagint, default 1Number of lags to apply before performing autocorrelation.



Returns:

floatThe Pearson correlation between self and self.shift(lag).

Series.shiftShift index by desired number of periods.

DataFrame.corrCompute pairwise correlation of columns.

DataFrame.corrwithCompute pairwise correlation between rows or columns of two DataFrame objects.



Notes
If the Pearson correlation is not well defined return âNaNâ.
Examples
>>> s = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.2, -0.05])
>>> s.autocorr()  
0.10355...
>>> s.autocorr(lag=2)  
-0.99999...


If the Pearson correlation is not well defined, then âNaNâ is returned.
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 0])
>>> s.autocorr()
nan
