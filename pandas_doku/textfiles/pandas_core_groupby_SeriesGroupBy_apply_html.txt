pandas.core.groupby.SeriesGroupBy.apply#


SeriesGroupBy.apply(func, *args, **kwargs)[source]#
Apply function func group-wise and combine the results together.
The function passed to apply must take a series as its first
argument and return a DataFrame, Series or scalar. apply will
then take care of combining the results back together into a single
dataframe or series. apply is therefore a highly flexible
grouping method.
While apply is a very flexible method, its downside is that
using it can be quite a bit slower than using more specific methods
like agg or transform. Pandas offers a wide range of method that will
be much faster than using apply for their specific purposes, so try to
use them before reaching for apply.

Parameters:

funccallableA callable that takes a series as its first argument, and
returns a dataframe, a series or a scalar. In addition the
callable may take positional and keyword arguments.

args, kwargstuple and dictOptional positional and keyword arguments to pass to func.



Returns:

Series or DataFrame

Notes

Changed in version 1.3.0: The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed func,
see the examples below.

Functions that mutate the passed object can produce unexpected
behavior or errors and are not supported. See Mutating with User Defined Function (UDF) methods
for more details.
Examples
>>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2], index='a a b'.split())
>>> g1 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=False)
>>> g2 = s.groupby(s.index, group_keys=True)


From s above we can see that g has two groups, a and b.
Notice that g1 have g2 have two groups, a and b, and only
differ in their group_keys argument. Calling apply in various ways,
we can get different grouping results:
Example 1: The function passed to apply takes a Series as
its argument and returns a Series. apply combines the result for
each group together into a new Series.

Changed in version 1.3.0: The resulting dtype will reflect the return value of the passed func.

>>> g1.apply(lambda x: x*2 if x.name == 'a' else x/2)
a    0.0
a    2.0
b    1.0
dtype: float64


In the above, the groups are not part of the index. We can have them included
by using g2 where group_keys=True:
>>> g2.apply(lambda x: x*2 if x.name == 'a' else x/2)
a  a    0.0
   a    2.0
b  b    1.0
dtype: float64


Example 2: The function passed to apply takes a Series as
its argument and returns a scalar. apply combines the result for
each group together into a Series, including setting the index as
appropriate:
>>> g1.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64


The group_keys argument has no effect here because the result is not
like-indexed (i.e. a transform) when compared
to the input.
>>> g2.apply(lambda x: x.max() - x.min())
a    1
b    0
dtype: int64
