pandas.plotting.bootstrap_plot#


pandas.plotting.bootstrap_plot(series, fig=None, size=50, samples=500, **kwds)[source]#
Bootstrap plot on mean, median and mid-range statistics.
The bootstrap plot is used to estimate the uncertainty of a statistic
by relying on random sampling with replacement [1]. This function will
generate bootstrapping plots for mean, median and mid-range statistics
for the given number of samples of the given size.

Parameters:

seriespandas.SeriesSeries from where to get the samplings for the bootstrapping.

figmatplotlib.figure.Figure, default NoneIf given, it will use the fig reference for plotting instead of
creating a new one with default parameters.

sizeint, default 50Number of data points to consider during each sampling. It must be
less than or equal to the length of the series.

samplesint, default 500Number of times the bootstrap procedure is performed.

**kwdsOptions to pass to matplotlib plotting method.



Returns:

matplotlib.figure.FigureMatplotlib figure.
