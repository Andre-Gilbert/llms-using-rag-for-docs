pandas.Series.cov#


Series.cov(other, min_periods=None, ddof=1)[source]#
Compute covariance with Series, excluding missing values.
The two Series objects are not required to be the same length and
will be aligned internally before the covariance is calculated.

Parameters:

otherSeriesSeries with which to compute the covariance.

min_periodsint, optionalMinimum number of observations needed to have a valid result.

ddofint, default 1Delta degrees of freedom. The divisor used in calculations
is N - ddof, where N represents the number of elements.



Returns:

floatCovariance between Series and other normalized by N-1
(unbiased estimator).

Examples
>>> s1 = pd.Series([0.90010907, 0.13484424, 0.62036035])
>>> s2 = pd.Series([0.12528585, 0.26962463, 0.51111198])
>>> s1.cov(s2)
