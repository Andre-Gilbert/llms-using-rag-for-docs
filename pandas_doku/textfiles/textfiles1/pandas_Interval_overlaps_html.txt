pandas.Interval.overlaps#


Interval.overlaps()#
Check whether two Interval objects overlap.
Two intervals overlap if they share a common point, including closed
endpoints. Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not
overlap.

Parameters:

otherIntervalInterval to check against for an overlap.



Returns:

boolTrue if the two intervals overlap.

Examples
>>> i1 = pd.Interval(0, 2)
>>> i2 = pd.Interval(1, 3)
>>> i1.overlaps(i2)
True
>>> i3 = pd.Interval(4, 5)
>>> i1.overlaps(i3)
False


Intervals that share closed endpoints overlap:
>>> i4 = pd.Interval(0, 1, closed='both')
>>> i5 = pd.Interval(1, 2, closed='both')
>>> i4.overlaps(i5)
True


Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap:
>>> i6 = pd.Interval(1, 2, closed='neither')
>>> i4.overlaps(i6)
False
