pandas.Series.index#


Series.index#
The index (axis labels) of the Series.
The index of a Series is used to label and identify each element of the
underlying data. The index can be thought of as an immutable ordered set
(technically a multi-set, as it may contain duplicate labels), and is
used to index and align data in pandas.

Returns:

IndexThe index labels of the Series.

Series.reindexConform Series to new index.

Series.set_indexSet Series as DataFrame index.

Examples
To create a Series with a custom index and view the index labels:
>>> cities = ['Kolkata', 'Chicago', 'Toronto', 'Lisbon']
>>> populations = [14.85, 2.71, 2.93, 0.51]
>>> city_series = pd.Series(populations, index=cities)
>>> city_series.index
Index(['Kolkata', 'Chicago', 'Toronto', 'Lisbon'], dtype='object')


To change the index labels of an existing Series:
>>> city_series.index = ['KOL', 'CHI', 'TOR', 'LIS']
>>> city_series.index
Index(['KOL', 'CHI', 'TOR', 'LIS'], dtype='object')
