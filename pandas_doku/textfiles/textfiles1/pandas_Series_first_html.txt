pandas.Series.first#


Series.first(offset)[source]#
Select initial periods of time series data based on a date offset.
For a DataFrame with a sorted DatetimeIndex, this function can
select the first few rows based on a date offset.

Parameters:

offsetstr, DateOffset or dateutil.relativedeltaThe offset length of the data that will be selected. For instance,
â1Mâ will display all the rows having their index within the first month.



Returns:

Series or DataFrameA subset of the caller.



Raises:

TypeErrorIf the index is not a DatetimeIndex

Examples
>>> i = pd.date_range('2018-04-09', periods=4, freq='2D')
>>> ts = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4]}, index=i)
>>> ts
            A
2018-04-09  1
2018-04-11  2
2018-04-13  3
2018-04-15  4


Get the rows for the first 3 days:
>>> ts.first('3D')
            A
2018-04-09  1
2018-04-11  2


Notice the data for 3 first calendar days were returned, not the first
3 days observed in the dataset, and therefore data for 2018-04-13 was
not returned.
