selects the last few rows based on a date offset.

â3Dâ will display all the rows having their index within the last 3 days.

Examples
>>> i = pd.date_range('2018-04-09', periods=4, freq='2D')
>>> ts = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4]}, index=i)
>>> ts
            A
2018-04-09  1
2018-04-11  2
2018-04-13  3
2018-04-15  4


Get the rows for the last 3 days:
>>> ts.last('3D') 
            A
2018-04-13  3
2018-04-15  4


Notice the data for 3 last calendar days were returned, not the last
3 observed days in the dataset, and therefore data for 2018-04-11 was
not returned.
