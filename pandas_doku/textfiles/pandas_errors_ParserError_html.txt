exception pandas.errors.ParserError[source]#
Exception that is raised by an error encountered in parsing file contents.
This is a generic error raised for errors encountered when functions like
read_csv or read_html are parsing contents of a file.

See also

read_csvRead CSV (comma-separated) file into a DataFrame.

read_htmlRead HTML table into a DataFrame.



Examples
>>> data = '''a,b,c
... cat,foo,bar
... dog,foo,"baz'''
>>> from io import StringIO
>>> pd.read_csv(StringIO(data), skipfooter=1, engine='python')
Traceback (most recent call last):
ParserError: ',' expected after '"'. Error could possibly be due
to parsing errors in the skipped footer rows
