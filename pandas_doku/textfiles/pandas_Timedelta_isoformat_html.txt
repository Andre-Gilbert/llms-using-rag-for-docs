Timedelta.isoformat()#
Format the Timedelta as ISO 8601 Duration.
P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S, where the [n] s are replaced by the
values. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations.

Timestamp.isoformatFunction is used to convert the given Timestamp object into the ISO format.



Notes
The longest component is days, whose value may be larger than
365.
Every component is always included, even if its value is 0.
Pandas uses nanosecond precision, so up to 9 decimal places may
be included in the seconds component.
Trailing 0âs are removed from the seconds component after the decimal.
We do not 0 pad components, so itâs â¦T5Hâ¦, not â¦T05Hâ¦
Examples
>>> td = pd.Timedelta(days=6, minutes=50, seconds=3,
...                   milliseconds=10, microseconds=10, nanoseconds=12)


>>> td.isoformat()
'P6DT0H50M3.010010012S'
>>> pd.Timedelta(hours=1, seconds=10).isoformat()
'P0DT1H0M10S'
>>> pd.Timedelta(days=500.5).isoformat()
'P500DT12H0M0S'
