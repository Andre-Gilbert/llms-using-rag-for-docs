pandas.Series.str.extractall#


Series.str.extractall(pat, flags=0)[source]#
Extract capture groups in the regex pat as columns in DataFrame.
For each subject string in the Series, extract groups from all
matches of regular expression pat. When each subject string in the
Series has exactly one match, extractall(pat).xs(0, level=âmatchâ)
is the same as extract(pat).

Parameters:

patstrRegular expression pattern with capturing groups.

flagsint, default 0 (no flags)A re module flag, for example re.IGNORECASE. These allow
to modify regular expression matching for things like case, spaces,
etc. Multiple flags can be combined with the bitwise OR operator,
for example re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE.



Returns:

DataFrameA DataFrame with one row for each match, and one column for each
group. Its rows have a MultiIndex with first levels that come from
the subject Series. The last level is named âmatchâ and indexes the
matches in each item of the Series. Any capture group names in
regular expression pat will be used for column names; otherwise capture
group numbers will be used.

extractReturns first match only (not all matches).



Examples
A pattern with one group will return a DataFrame with one column.
Indices with no matches will not appear in the result.
>>> s = pd.Series(["a1a2", "b1", "c1"], index=["A", "B", "C"])
>>> s.str.extractall(r"[ab](\d)")
        0
match
A 0      1
  1      2
B 0      1


Capture group names are used for column names of the result.
>>> s.str.extractall(r"[ab](?P<digit>\d)")
        digit
match
A 0         1
  1         2
B 0         1


A pattern with two groups will return a DataFrame with two columns.
>>> s.str.extractall(r"(?P<letter>[ab])(?P<digit>\d)")
        letter digit
match
A 0          a     1
  1          a     2
B 0          b     1


Optional groups that do not match are NaN in the result.
>>> s.str.extractall(r"(?P<letter>[ab])?(?P<digit>\d)")
        letter digit
match
A 0          a     1
  1          a     2
B 0          b     1
C 0        NaN     1
