pandas.HDFStore.walk#


HDFStore.walk(where='/')[source]#
Walk the pytables group hierarchy for pandas objects.
This generator will yield the group path, subgroups and pandas object
names for each group.
Any non-pandas PyTables objects that are not a group will be ignored.
The where group itself is listed first (preorder), then each of its
child groups (following an alphanumerical order) is also traversed,
following the same procedure.

Parameters:

wherestr, default â/âGroup where to start walking.



Yields:

pathstrFull path to a group (without trailing â/â).

groupslistNames (strings) of the groups contained in path.

leaveslistNames (strings) of the pandas objects contained in path.




Examples
>>> df1 = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]], columns=['A', 'B'])
>>> store = pd.HDFStore("store.h5", 'w')  
>>> store.put('data', df1, format='table')  
>>> df2 = pd.DataFrame([[5, 6], [7, 8]], columns=['A', 'B'])
>>> store.append('data', df2)  
>>> store.close()  
>>> for group in store.walk():  
...     print(group)  
>>> store.close()
